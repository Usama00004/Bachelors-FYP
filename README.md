# Thermal-Aware Data Center Workload Simulator

## Overview
The Thermal-Aware Data Center Workload Simulator is a project aimed at addressing the issue of heat generation in data centers due to continuous server operations. This project introduces thermal-aware load balancing policies to efficiently manage the workload in data centers, minimizing heat generation while optimizing resource utilization.

## Abstract
Servers are running around the clock that generates huge amount of heat and in out-turn it arises the temperature in datacenters. High temperature effects the other components like racks, power supply and cabling system in the datacenters. Cooling system are being used to control the temperature of datacenters that are very much costly. We introduced thermal aware load balancing policies in datacenters, which will keep the track of heat generated by servers and manage the load of data in such a way that servers will generate minimum amount of heat. It would not only keep the temperature of datacenters in control but also reduces the cost of coolants and cooling systems. It will keep the track for amount of heat generated by each server through visual representation using visualization tool. This would help to implement and choose the load balancing policies in datacenters for work load according to the temperature measures that best suits the respective datacenter.
